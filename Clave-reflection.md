**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
    I was a little confused about merge conflicts and how to resolve them.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
    How merge conflicts occur and the process of resolving them was clarified. I also learned and gained more experience about how to use GitHub in a team setting.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
    I asked about remote/origin in commands such as "git push <remote> <branch>".

**What still confuses you about Git?**
    As of right now, I am comfortable with the concepts of Git. I understand what its purpose is and how to use it. With more experience using Git, questions may arise for me in the future.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
    I enjoyed my first experience. It's different from doing work individually since you have to keep your partner updated. I'm looking forward to working on more difficult challenges.
